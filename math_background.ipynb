    "# Math Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the following sets, indices, and independent variables used throughout this formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ S $: Set of mobile phase ions\n",
    "- $ P $: Set of proteins or large solutes\n",
    "- $ i, k \\in S $: Indices for ion species (with $ k \\ne i $ used for pairwise exchange)\n",
    "- $ j \\in P $: Index for protein species\n",
    "- $ t $: Time (dimensional)\n",
    "- $ z $: Axial position along the column (dimensional)\n",
    "\n",
    "All concentrations $ C_x $ refer to mobile phase concentrations, and $ Q_x $ refer to corresponding concentrations bound to the resin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalized Stoichiometric Ion-Exchange Reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider reversible exchange between mobile ions and bound species on a charged resin. Two categories of reactions are defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Ion–Ion Exchange:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_{i} + Q_{k} \\overset{K_{eq,i-k}}{\\rightleftharpoons} Q_{i} + C_{k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- A unique equilibrium must be defined for each ion-ion pair\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Protein–Ion Exchange (SMA model):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_j + \\nu_j \\overline{Q}_{i} \\overset{K_{eq,j-i}}{\\rightleftharpoons} Q_j + \\nu_j C_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ \\nu_j $: number of counterions displaced per molecule of protein $ j $\n",
    "- $ \\overline{Q}_i $: exchangeable bound counterion $ i $, not sterically hindered by adsorbed protein\n",
    "- A unique equilibrium must be defined for each protein-ion pair\n",
    "- This follows the **Steric Mass Action (SMA)** framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** No protein–protein exchange equilibrium is defined. Proteins are assumed not to displace each other directly. Instead, competition for binding sites and steric exclusion are captured implicitly through the total resin capacity and the exclusion coefficients in the SMA framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exchangeable Counterion Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The term $ \\overline{Q}_i $ represents the **exchangeable** portion of counterion $ i $ already bound to the resin. These are ions that are not sterically blocked by adsorbed proteins and are therefore available to participate in further ion-exchange reactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This exchangeable fraction is a function of:\n",
    "- The total ionic capacity of the resin $ \\Lambda $\n",
    "- The amount of protein bound $ Q_j $\n",
    "- Each protein’s displacement coefficient $ \\nu_j $\n",
    "- Each protein's steric factor $ \\sigma_j $, representing the number of additional binding sites rendered inaccessible to other proteins due to steric hindrance from a single bound molecule of protein $ j $, though these sites remain available for ion-ion exchange\n",
    "- The bound concentrations of other counterions $ Q_k $\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this framework, $ \\overline{Q}_i $ can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\overline{Q}_i = \\Lambda - \\sum_{j \\in P} (\\nu_j + \\sigma_j) Q_j - \\sum_{k \\in S, k \\ne i} \\overline{Q}_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We assume that the distribution of ion species within the blocked fraction mirrors that of the total bound ions.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\overline{Q}_k}{\\sum_{k \\in S, k \\ne i} \\overline{Q}_k} = \\frac{Q_k}{\\sum_{k \\in S, k \\ne i} Q_k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Substituted into the original equation and rearranged, we get the following.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\overline{Q}_i = \\frac{\\Lambda - \\sum_{j \\in P} (\\nu_j + \\sigma_j) Q_j}{1 + \\frac{\\sum_{k \\in S, k \\ne i} Q_k}{Q_i}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kinetic Binding Equations\n",
    "We express the rate of change of bound species concentrations using kinetic mass balance equations. These expressions account for adsorption and desorption reactions between ions, proteins, and the resin surface, scaled by the system's characteristic residence time $ t_{\\text{res}} $. \n",
